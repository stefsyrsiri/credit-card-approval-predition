# Credit Card Approval Prediction
![demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/426827/812605/719b66b4a3afd1da8c107b026c66fa91/dataset-cover.jpg?t=2019-11-28-02-30-42)

Our banking client has tasked us to assess their clients risk in order to automate the credit card application procedures.

We have been provided with two datasets:
1. Dataset of applications records
2. Credit records of existing clients of the bank

Our goal is to develop a machine learning model in order to assess whether an applicant qualifies for a credit card, and therefore whether their application is going to be approved or desclined. To do that we need to assess whether a client holds high or low risk.
Notably, the criteria for categorizing an applicant as 'approved' or 'declined' is unspecified in our data.
