# Credit Card Approval Prediction | Credit Risk Assessment
![dataset-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90d9b6c9-6b04-453e-a117-67961d94df80)

### Overview
Our banking client has tasked us to assess their clients risk in order to automate the credit card application procedures.

We have been provided with two datasets:
1. `application_record.csv` : Dataset of applications records
2. `credit_record.csv` : Credit records of existing clients of the bank

Our goal is to develop a machine learning model in order to assess whether an applicant qualifies for a credit card, and therefore whether their application is going to be approved or desclined. To do that we need to assess whether a client holds high or low risk.
Notably, the criteria for categorizing an applicant as 'approved' or 'declined' is unspecified in our data.
