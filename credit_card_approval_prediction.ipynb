The amount falls significantly at the 15th month and this will be the threshold to help us construct our target variable. It is apparent that the less frequent cases are those that occur after 35 months (less than 1%), but 3~ years is a very wide window to consider. That is why we're restricting debts earlier.

If data is allowed to lie far from the more central area towards the ends of the whiskers, then we need to define how far the data needs to be to be considered something that needs to be fixed. For that, we will use the quantiles and specifically set bounds that are 3 times away from the IQR of the data (of people having children). We chose 3 instead of 1.5 which is more standard so as not to be too strict. We also don't use a lower bound as it's impossible to have a negative amount of children (and we also didn't see any negative values in EDA).\n",
